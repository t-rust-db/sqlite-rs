//! Spike 010: `rust-refine` (mvl-lang/mvl-rust) proof-of-concept, standalone.
//!
//! Issue #371. See `findings.md` in this directory for the full narrative
//! across six rounds of testing against successive `mvl-rust` releases.
//! This crate is the self-contained evidence: every function below
//! compiles against the pinned `mvl` dependency in `Cargo.toml` and can be
//! run through `cargo mvl prove src/lib.rs` to reproduce the exact
//! `layer`/`warrant` reported in `findings.md`, independent of the main
//! `sqlite-rs` package (which carries none of this — see "Disposition" in
//! `findings.md`).
//!
//! Deliberately a flat file, no `pub mod { ... }` wrappers: nested modules
//! turned out to hide return-site obligations and `impl` methods entirely
//! from `cargo mvl prove` (declaration-site free-function obligations are
//! the only thing that still gets found through a module) — a real, fifth
//! solver-scanning limitation found while building this spike, noted in
//! `findings.md` but out of scope to fix here. Everything below is
//! module-free specifically to give an accurate, representative reading.
