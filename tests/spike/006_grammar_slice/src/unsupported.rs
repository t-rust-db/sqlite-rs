//! "Unsupported" classification: the third outcome the spike falsification
//! criterion requires alongside accept/syntax-error.
//!
//! The sliced grammar has no productions at all for V3/V4+ constructs, so it
//! cannot distinguish "well-formed SQL outside this slice" from "malformed
//! SQL" structurally -- both come back as a `Token`-level syntax error from
//! pomelo. Instead, a cheap keyword sniff runs first: if the input's first
//! keyword or a scan of its keywords match a known out-of-slice feature, that
//! is reported as "unsupported" with the V-block it belongs to; anything else
//! that fails to parse is a genuine syntax error.
//!
//! This is intentionally coarse (no full lexing, just a whitespace/word
//! split) -- good enough to answer the falsification question ("can
//! unsupported vs invalid be distinguished at all") without building a
//! second tokenizer.
