//! End-to-end oracle-diff tests for `CREATE VIEW`/`DROP VIEW` storage
//! and query expansion (#380) — via the `sqlite-rs` CLI's `exec`/`query`
//! subcommands, mirroring `cte_test.rs`'s scratch-db-per-test shape. A
//! view is registered in `sqlite_master` (`type = 'view'`, `rootpage =
//! 0`, verbatim source text) exactly like real SQLite, so an
//! oracle-diff test can run `CREATE VIEW` through our own `exec`
//! binary and then query the *same on-disk file* through either engine
//! — unlike a CTE (purely an in-query AST rewrite), a view's
//! queryability must survive being reloaded from `sqlite_master` by a
//! fresh process, which is the scenario this file's persistence test
//! specifically exercises.
