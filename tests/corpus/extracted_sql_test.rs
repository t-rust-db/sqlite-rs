//! Ratchets sqlite-rs's tokenizer and parser against the extracted external
//! SQL corpus — issue #70, follow-up to #2.
//!
//! `sql_corpus_test.rs` validates the *labels* on #2's hand-curated corpus by
//! asking a real `sqlite3` whether each statement runs. That approach does not
//! transfer here: extracted statements are lifted out of their originating
//! `.test` file and so reference tables, attached databases and triggers that
//! file created (`CREATE TABLE aux.t4(...)`). Replaying them standalone would
//! fail for reasons that say nothing about sqlite-rs. Whole-file replay in
//! original order is #96's job (the sqllogictest slice runner).
//!
//! What *is* checkable statement-by-statement, without a schema and without an
//! oracle, is our own front end. Every statement here was accepted by real
//! SQLite in the suite it came from, which gives two invariants:
//!
//! 1.  **Tokenizer totality** — no statement may produce `TokenKind::Error`.
//!     Real SQLite tokenized all of them; a lexer error is our bug.
//! 2.  **No false syntax errors** — no extracted SELECT may come back
//!     `ParseOutcome::Invalid`. `Accepted` and `Unsupported` are both fine
//!     (the V2 parser is a deliberate grammar slice), but `Invalid` claims
//!     valid SQL is malformed, which is always wrong.
//!
//! Unlike the #2 harness this needs no oracle, so it runs in the default
//! `make test` loop rather than behind `make test-corpus`.
//!
//! The corpus-presence and tokenizer-totality invariants are checked once
//! per source corpus (`tcl`/`sqllogictest` — the two subdirectory-less `.sql`
//! filenames `tools/extract_sql_corpus.py` writes per category) rather than
//! once over both combined, so `make test-tcl`/`make test-sqllogictest` can
//! select just one via cargo's test-name substring filter (`_tcl`/
//! `_sqllogictest`) without a second test binary. The SELECT-invalid ratchet
//! ([`SELECT_INVALID_BASELINE`]) stays combined — its baseline count was
//! derived and is documented against the combined corpus, and splitting it
//! would require re-deriving two baselines for no invariant-strength gain.
