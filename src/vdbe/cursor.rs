//! Cursor opcodes (spec 009, Requirement 4): real table cursors over
//! V1's `TableCursor` (`OpenRead`/`Rewind`/`Last`/`Next`/`Column`/
//! `Rowid`/`SeekRowid`/`NullRow`), an in-memory ephemeral index for
//! DISTINCT (`OpenEphemeral`/`Sequence`/`Found`/`IdxInsert`/`IdxLE`/
//! `Delete`, per the epic's #87 scope decision — never the on-disk file
//! format), an in-memory ephemeral **table** (#257, `OpenEphemeral` with
//! `P5` nonzero) that materializes a subquery-in-FROM and is then scanned
//! with the same `Rewind`/`Last`/`Next`/`Column`/`Rowid`/`Insert` opcodes
//! a real table cursor uses, and a single-row pseudo-cursor (`OpenPseudo`)
//! that lets `Column` read an already-computed record (the sorter's
//! output row) without a special case. A real secondary-index read
//! cursor (`OpenRead` with `P5` nonzero) supports both a one-shot point
//! lookup (`SeekIndexEq`/`IdxRowid`, #243) and a full sequential walk
//! (`IdxRewind`/`IdxLast`/`IdxNext`/`IdxPrev`, #296) for an
//! index-ordered `ORDER BY` scan — see [`IndexReadState`]'s doc.
//!
//! Register/cursor-slot conventions used by this module's opcodes (this
//! ticket's own choice — codegen, #91, is what will actually decide
//! operand layout against the pinned oracle's `EXPLAIN` output; nothing
//! here claims byte-for-byte parity with a harvested instruction's
//! P1..P5, only with the opcode's *semantics*):
//! - `OpenRead(p1=cursor, p2=root page)`
//! - `OpenEphemeral(p1=cursor)` — key-column count isn't needed by this
//!   in-memory implementation (the whole register range passed to
//!   `Found`/`IdxInsert` *is* the key), so `P2` is unused here. `P5`
//!   nonzero (#257) opens the table-mode variant instead (see below).
//! - `OpenPseudo(p1=cursor, p2=register holding the row's record blob)`
//! - `Rewind`/`Last(p1=cursor, p2=jump target if the table is empty)`
//! - `Next(p1=cursor, p2=jump target if another row was found)` —
//!   mirrors the oracle's own `OP_Next` shape: jump back into the loop
//!   body on success, fall through to end the loop on exhaustion.
//! - `Column(p1=cursor, p2=column index, p3=dest register)`
//! - `Rowid(p1=cursor, p2=dest register)`
//! - `SeekRowid(p1=cursor, p2=jump target if not found, p3=register
//!   holding the target rowid)`
//! - `NullRow(p1=cursor)`
//! - `Sequence(p1=cursor, p2=dest register)` — also works on a table-mode
//!   ephemeral cursor (#257), handing out fresh rowids starting at `1`.
//! - `Found(p1=cursor, p2=jump target if the key is present, p3=first
//!   key register, p4=Int(key column count))`
//! - `IdxInsert(p1=cursor, p2=first key register, p4=Int(key column
//!   count))`
//! - `IdxLE(p1=cursor, p2=jump target, p3=first key register,
//!   p4=Int(key column count))` — see [`idx_le`]'s doc for this
//!   opcode's known scope limitation.
//! - `Delete(p1=cursor)` — deletes the entry `Found`/`IdxInsert` most
//!   recently probed/inserted on this cursor.
